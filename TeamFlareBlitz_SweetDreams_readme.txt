Start Scene: Menu

Requirements/How To Play: From the Menu, you can click Start Game to begin playing. You are tasked with fulfilling multiple drink orders in time by buying and gathering ingredients from a store combined with a "dream potion" located in the basement. You can control a 3D character in realtime with WASD, and interact with other objects in the scene, picking up and placing ingredients. You can collide with the walls as well as go down stairs to the basement level. There are npc "customers" that are powered by real-time steering behaviors, entering the store and only leaving once their orders are complete.
